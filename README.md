A handy [pre-commit](http://pre-commit.com/) hook which will run Google's java
code style formatter for you on your code!

Usage:

    hooks:

```

*Note*: this file stores Google's code style formatter jar in a `.cache/`
directory so that it doesn't need to be re-downloaded each time.  You will
probably want to add `.cache/` to the `.gitignore` file of the project which
uses this hook.
